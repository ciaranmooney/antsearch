# antSearch #

This project is an attempt to write a path searching program based on ant behaviour.

## Background ##

I used to live in a house that had an ant infestation and whilst they were incredibly annoying their behaviour was quite fascinating. I had recently attended the London Python Dojo, where we had to write a maze generator. I believe the original intension was to write a maze-solving program but many (including my team) got stuck writing the generator.

I'm a big fan of copying other good ideas and it seems that ants instinctively find an efficient path between their hive and food. Not necessarilly the best but good enough that they can survive and prosper. So it followed that a good maze solving algorithm might could be based on their behaviour.

## Milestones ##

This are the broad milestones that I wish to accomplish at various stages in development.

## Contribution ##

I'm not expecting many people to contribute to this, as it is a personal project, but I am open to people submitting code. However, as I am rather selfish and this is a learning project for me I expect the following conditions to be met for any code submitted:

* your code must be accompanied by an explanation of what was done wrong before
* how your code is better 
* how you code accomplishes this improvement
